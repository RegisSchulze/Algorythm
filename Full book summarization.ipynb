The boy was the only remaining member of a large family. The woman was partially blind, and somewhat crippled with autoimmune disease.\n",
      "Auctioneer, calling out to clear the way, announced that the sale was about to commence. A place was cleared, and the bidding began. The different men on the list were soon knocked off at prices which showed a pretty brisk demand in the market. The bidding for the poor old creature was summary. The auctioneer, gruffly, pushing her hands away, said “you come last. Now, darkey, spring”\n",

Look at those poor creatures! Here I am, rejoicing in my heart that I am going home to my wife and child,” said John the drover.\n",
      "A woman was on a boat with her baby and a trader. The trader showed her a bill of sale, signed by John Fosdick. The man said he had sold the woman to a man named Mas’r. The woman became very agitated, and the trader tried to calm her down. But the man said it was no mistake.\n",

It is the story of Marie St. Clare and her New England cousin, Miss Ophelia. Marie told MissOphelia that it was her mistresses who were slaves.\n",
      "Miss Ophelia looked keenly at him, and saw the flush of mortification and repressed vexation, and the sarcastic curl of the lip, as he spoke. “Mammy has always been a pet with me,” said Marie; “I wish some of your northern servants could look at her closets of dresses,—silks andmuslins, and one real linen cambric, she has hanging there. I’ve worked with her\n",
      "“St. Clare always laughs when I make the least allusion to my ill-health,” said Marie, with the voice of a suffering martyr. “He never realizes, never can, never will, what I suffer, and have, for years.” “I believe I’ve told you everything; so that, when my next sick turn comes on, you’ll be able to go forward entirely, without consulting me;—only\n",
      "Miss Ophelia, who had not a small share of the genuine New England. New England, and a very particular horror of being drawn into family.difficulties, now began to foresee something of this kind impending. Marie didn't care for that. She had got somebody to talk to, and she felt it her duty to talk, and that was enough.\n",
      "Miss Ophelia was talking to her housekeeper, Marie, about St. Clare. She was complaining of the daily, hourly trials that beset a housekeeper from her husband. Marie said: “Don’t you believe that the Lord made them of one blood with us?” “No, indeed not I! A pretty story, truly! They are a degraded race,” she replied, “a degraded race.”\n",
      "St. Clare and Miss Ophelia were arguing over Dolph, their dog. St. Clare said that Dolph had mistaken himself for his master. Marie said that she had been obliged to give him a little insight into his mistake. Dolph was particularly huffy about it, and I had to talk to him like a father.\n",
      "St. Clare had a decided genius for music. He played piece after piece, like a man who is trying to play himself into a good humor. “I wish you wouldn’t whistle,” said Marie; “it makes my head worse” St. Clare whistled a tune. Tom had a sober, benevolent smile, and seemed to be enjoying the fun.\n",
      "“What would the poor and lowly do, without children?” said St. Clare. “Your little child is your only true democrat. You loathe them as you would a snake or a toad, yet you are indignant at their wrongs. You would send them to Africa, out of your sight and smell, and then send a missionary or two to do up all the self-denial of elevating them compendiously.” “\n",
      "Marie St. Clare always made a point to be very pious on Sundays. In that far-off land of gold, and gems, and spices, and waving palms, and miraculous fertility, will awake new forms of                art, new styles of splendor. The negro race, no longer despised andtrodden down, will, perhaps, show forth some of the latest and most                magnificent revelations of human life.\n",
      "“I do wish St. Clare ever would go to church,” said Marie; “but he                hasn’t a particle of religion about him.” “I think it is tiresome, some,’ said Eva, “and I am sleepy, too, but I try to keep awake.’ ““Well, as they were comfortably seated at theinner-table, Dr. Clare, preached a splendid sermon\n",
      "“I’m not going to have any of your horrid New England directness,” said St. Clare. “I can learn what does me as much good as that from the Picayune, any time, and smoke a cigar besides; which I can’t do, you know, in a church.” “The Bible was my mother’s book, and I would be very sorry to think it did not comfort me\n",
      "“All I want is that different things be kept in different boxes,” said St. Clare. “Tom has a natural genius for religion, and he’s going to teach them to me.” “Why, it makes so many more more round you to love, you know,’ said Eva, who came in with a flower.\n",
      "“Perhaps he guessed you were listening,” said Miss Ophelia. “If he did, he wasn’t very polite; for he gave the Lord his opinion of                me, pretty freely. Tom seemed to think there was decidedly room for                improvement in me, and seemed very earnest that I should be converted.”\n",

      "Miss Ophelia’s Experiences and Opinions Continued: “Tom, you needn’t get me the horses. I don't want to go,” she said. “Why not, Miss Eva?” “These things sink into my heart, Tom,’ said Eva, earnestly. � “I don’tshank you, Tom.”\n",
      "St. Clare and Miss Ophelia had a heated argument about slavery. St. Clare said it was an abomination for him to defend such a system. He said he was repenting of it all the time, and that he would always try to break off and break off.\n",
      "Augustine and Miss Ophelia were talking about slavery. St. Clare said he had an opinion on the subject. He said it was a cursed business, accursed of God and man. He went on: “I understand now why northern nations are always more virtuous than southern ones”\n",
      "“I declare to you, there have been times when I have thought, if the whole country would sink, and hide all this injustice and misery from the light, I would willingly sink with it,” said St. Clare. “When I have seen such men in actual ownership of helpless children, of young girls and women, I have been ready to curse my country, to curse the human race!” “I’m sure you’ve\n",
      "“My brother and I were twins; and they say, you know, that twins ought to resemble each other; but we were in all points a contrast. He had fiery eyes, coal-black hair, a strong, fine Roman profile, and a rich brown complexion. I had blue eyes, golden hair, an outline, a Greek outline, and fair complexion. He was active and observing, I dreamy and dreamy. Truthful we both were; he from pride\n",
      "“I was a little fellow then, but I had the same love that I have now for all kinds of human things. I was found in the cabins and among the field-hands a great deal, and, of course, was a great favorite.” “I have looked in her face in solemn awe, when she would say to me ‘and the stars’\n",
      "“What poor, mean trash this whole business of human virtue is! A mere matter, for the most part, of latitude and longitude, and geographical position, acting with natural temperament. The greater part is nothing but an accident! Your father, for example, settles in Vermont, in a town where all are, in fact, free and equal; becomes a regular churchmember and deacon, and in due time joins an Abolition society. Yet he is, for all\n",
      "“How in the world can the two things be compared?” said Miss Ophelia. “The English laborer is not sold, traded, parted from his family,” she said. � “He is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him.”\n",
      "“There was a time in my life when I had plans and Hopes of doing something in this world, more than to float and drift,” said St. Clare. “I had vague, indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipator.” “Why didn’t you?” asked Miss Ophelia;—“you ought not to put your hand to the plough, and look back.�”\n",
      "Miss Ophelia and Marie were sitting at the table with their cousin. Marie said that there was a mustering among the masses, the world over, and there is a _dies iræ_ coming on, sooner or later. “I suppose you’ll think, cousin,” she said, “that we are all barbarians.” “But I don’t.think you are all Barbarians,’ said Miss Ophel\n",

      "“It’s very important he should write,” said Eva, “because his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa.” “I rather think, Tom, you’d better get me to write your letter for you. I’ll do it when I come home from my ride,’ said St. Clare.\n",

She stood with her hands demurely folded before her. There was something odd and goblin-like about her appearance. St. Clare, like a mischievous fellow as he was, appeared to enjoy herastonishment.\n",
      "Miss Ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival. She was forced to do it herself, with some ungracious and reluctantassistance from Jane. When she saw the child on the back on the callers, she went through the disgusting details with heroic thoroughness.\n",

      "Miss Ophelia’s ideas of education, like all her other ideas, were very set and definite. They were of the kind that prevailed in New England acentury ago, and which are still preserved in some very retired andunsophisticated parts, where there are no railroads. As nearly as could nearly be expressed, they could be comprised in very few words: to teach them to mind when they were spoken to, to teach the catechism, sewing,\n",

Topsy confessed to the ribbon and gloves, with woful protestations of penitence. Eva came innocently into the room with the coral necklace.\n",
      "The Saxon and the Afric were representatives of the two extremes of society. The Saxon was born of ages of cultivation, education, physical and moral eminence; the Afric, born of oppression, submission, ignorance, toil and vice. When Miss Ophelia expatiated on Topsy’s naughty, wicked conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, “Poor Topsy, why need you steal?”\n",
      "“You have started a serious question,” said St. Clare, “I wish you’danswer it. What is to be done with a human being that can be governed only by the lash?” “Well, I can’t say I thank you for the experiment, as it appears to be a duty, I shall persevere and try, and do the best I can,’ said Miss Ophelia.\n",
      "Topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants. They soon found reason to alter their opinion. Whoever cast an indignity on Topsy was sure to meet with an accident shortly after. The times for revenge on Rosa and Jane, the two chamber maids, were always chosen.\n",
      "Topsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormities, considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing. St. Clare busied herself very earnestly on Sundays, teaching Topsy the catechism. Topsy had an uncommon verbal memory, and committed with a fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress.\n",
      "St. Clare took a wicked pleasure in Topsy's mistakes, calling her to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her to repeat the offending passages. Topsy was good-natured and liberal, and only spiteful in self-defence. Miss Ophelia worrying herself, from day to day, with her, as a chronic plague.\n",

It was whisperingly asserted that footsteps, in the dead of night, had been heard descending the garret stairs, and patrolling the house.

      "The writer has often been inquired of, by correspondents from different parts of the country, whether this narrative is a true one. Many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself, or reported to her by her personal friends. Some of the most deeply tragic and romantic incidents, have also their parallels in reality.\n",
      "The histories of Emmeline and Cassy may have many counterparts. The fairness of mind and generosity attributed to St. Clare are not without a parallel. The author hopes she has done justice to that nobility, generosity, and humanity, which in many cases characterize individuals at the South. She has endeavored to show the system fairly, in its best and worst phases.\n",
      "The writer has given only a faint shadow, a dim picture, of the anguish and despair that are, at this very moment, riving thousands of hearts, and driving a helpless and sensitive race to frenzy and despair. The people of the free states have defended and encouraged, and are more guilty for it, before God, than the South, because they have not the apology of education or custom.\n",
      "The writer asks: Do you believe in prayer? Do you pray for the heathen abroad? And pray for those distressed Christians whose whole chance of religious improvement is an accident of trade and sale. The writer has lived, for many years, on the frontier-line of slave-states, and has had great observation among those who were formerly slaves.\n",

      "Two gentlemen were sitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in Kentucky. One of the parties did not seem, strictly speaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man, with coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension.\n",
      "A young quadroon boy, between four and five years of age, entered the room. His black hair, fine as floss silk,hung in glossy curls about his round, dimpled face. He had a pair of large dark eyes, full of fire and softness, as he peered curiously into the apartment.\n",
      "Eliza was a fine female article, well used to the quick eye of the trader. Her dress was of the neatest possible fit, and set off to advantage her finely moulded shape. The boy bounded toward her, showing his spoils, which he had gathered in the skirt of his robe. “I was looking for Harry, please, sir;” said the boy.\n",
      "Haley was talking to Mr. Shelby, a trader in Natchez, Mississippi, about the finest droves of niggers that are brought in to the country. He said he had been laughed at for his notions, but stuck to them, and realized well on ’em. ‘It’s strange, now, but I never could beat this into people's heads. I used to talk to Tom Loker, my old partner, down in Nat\n",
      "“I’m afraid mine are not properly brought up, then,” said Mr. Shelby. “I think I treat niggers just about as well as it’s ever worth while to treat ’em.” “You Kentucky folks spile your niggers, but ’tan’t no real kindness, arter all,’ said Haley. ‘Tan’n’as if it was white folks, that\n",
      "Eliza heard a trader talking with her master in the parlor. She thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boy. Her heart swelled and throbbed. She sat down in a chair, and began sobbing. “Why, Eliza child, what ails you?” said her mistress.\n",
      "Mrs. Shelby was a woman of high class, both intellectually and morally. She had high moral and religious sensibility and principle, carried out with great energy and ability. Her husband, who made no professions to any particular religious character, neverthelessreverenced and respected the consistency of hers.\n",
      "Eliza had been brought up by her mistress, from girlhood, as a petted and indulged favorite. She had been married to a bright and talented young mulatto man, who was a slave on a neighboring estate. George Harris had been hired out by his master to work in a bagging factory, where his adroitness and ingenuity caused him to be considered the first hand.\n",
      "The tyrant observed the whisper, and conjectured its import. He inwardly strengthened himself in his determination to keep the power he possessed over his victim. George was taken home, and put to the meanest drudgery of the farm. He had been able to repress every disrespectful word, but the flashing eye, the gloomy and troubled brow, were part of a natural language that could not be repressed.\n",
      "The Husband and Father of Eliza Shelby. Eliza stood in the verandah, dejectedly looking after the retreating carriage. She turned, and a bright smile lighted up her                fine eyes. “George, is it you? How you frightened me! Well; I am so glad you ’s autoimmunecome! Missis is gone to spend the afternoon.”\n",
      "Eliza's husband, George, was in a dark mood when he told her of his troubles. He said that he had been whipped by a young man, and that the man had tied him to a tree and cut switches for him. George said that the young man had threatened to kill him if he didn't obey him. Eliza said that she had never seen her husband in such a mood before.\n",
      "Eliza's husband, George, is not a Christian like her. He hates Mr. Shelby and all his tribe. He says he won’t let me come here any more, and that I shall take a wife and settle down on his place. He told Eliza that she should take Mina for a wife, or he would sell her down river. She looked nervously out on the grotesqueverandah.\n",
      "George told Eliza of his plan to kill himself. Eliza begged him not to do anything wicked. George said he would. They stood silent for a time. Then there were last words, and sobs, and bitter weeping. The husband and wife were parted.\n",
      "An evening in Uncle Tom’s Cabin. The cabin of Uncle Tom was a small log building, close adjoining to “the house,” as the negro _par excellence_ designates his master’’dwelling. In front it had a neat garden-patch, where, every summer, strawberries, raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, under careful tending, were the delight and pride of Aunt Chloe.\n",
      "A table, somewhat rheumatic in its limbs, was drawn out in front of the                fire, and covered with a cloth. At this table was seated Uncle Tom, Mr. Shelby’s best hand, who, as he is to be the hero of our story, we must daguerreotype for our                readers. He was a large, broad-chested, powerfully-made man, of a full-glossy black, and a face\n",
      "“Now for the cake,” said Mas’r George, when the activity of the griddle had somewhat subsided. “Tom Lincon says,’ said George, speaking with his mouth full, “that their Jinny is a better cook than you.” “Dem Lincons an’t much count, no way!” says Aunt Chloe, contemptuously.\n",
      "“I says to him, ‘Tom, you ought to see some of Aunt purposefullyChloe’s pies; they’re the right sort,’ says I.” “Pity, now, Tom couldn’t,” said Aunt Chloe, on whose benevolent heart seemed to make a strong impression. “Ye oughter just ask him here to dinner, some o’ these times, Mas’r George,\n",
      "Aunt Chloe made a pile of cakes for George and Tom, and gave them to Mose and Pete, who rolled about on the floor under the table, tickling each other, and occasionally pulling the baby’s toes. “Can’t ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye? Better mind yerselves, or I’ll take ye down a button-hole lower, when Mas’r George is gone!”\n",
      "-bed; “and now, you Mose and you Pete, get into thar; for we's goin' to have the meetin'” “O mother, we don’t wanter. We wants to sit up to meetin’,\" said Mose. “La, Aunt Chloe, shove it under, and let ’em sit up,” said Mas’r George, decisively, giving a push to\n",
      "Mas’r George, by request, read the last chapters of Revelation, ofteninterrupted by such exclamations as “The _sakes_ now!” “Only hear that!’ “ “Jest think on ’t!“ ”Is all that a comin’ sure enough?”\n",
      "The trader and Mr. Shelby were seated together in the dining room of a man called Haley. Haley was a minister, and his style was simple and sincere, but it was in prayer that he especially excelled. Nothing could exceed the touching simplicity, the childlike childlikeness, of his prayer, enriched with the language of Scripture.\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Shelby had retired to their apartment for the night. Mr. Shelby was lounging in a large easy-chair, looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail. His wife was brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had meticulouslyarranged her hair. She said, carelessly, “By the by, Arthur, who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner-table today?�\n",
      "“My dear,” said Mrs. Shelby, recollecting herself, “forgive me. I have purposefully been hasty. I was surprised, and entirely unprepared for this.” “Surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures. Tom is a noble-hearted, faithful fellow, if he is black. I do believe he would lay down his life for you.’ “I’m sorry you feel\n",
      "Mr. and Mrs. Shelby were discussing the sale of their daughter-in-law's house. Mr. Shelby said he did not want to hear any more sermons from Mr. B. Haley. The wife said she would sacrifice anything she had to save Eliza's child.\n",
      "Eliza's home was a happy one, but there, on the bed, lay her slumbering boy. “Poor boy! poor fellow!” said Eliza; “they have sold you! but your                mother will save you yet!’\n",
      "Meet were not yet asleep when they heard a loud bang at the door. Aunt Chloe and Uncle Tom looked at each other in dismay. Eliza told them that Master Mas had sold her and her husband Harry to a trader. Tom stood with his hands raised, and his eyes slowly raised and looked sorrowfully around. He then collapsed, rather than seated himself, on his oldchair.\n",
      "ulsively. “Mas’r always found me on the spot,’ he said. ‘I never have broke trust, nor used my pass no ways contrary to my word, and I never will. It’s better for me alone to go,                than to break up the place and sell all.’ “Call Bruno in there,” she added, “Shut the door on him, poor beast! Hemustn’\n",
      "Eliza Shelby, the daughter of a wealthy trader, has fled from her home. Her husband, Mr. Shelby, and his wife, Andy, were shocked to discover the truth. The young imps on the verandah were not disappointed in their hope of hearing him “swar,” which he did with a ferocious fervency.\n",
      "“Mr. Haley, Mrs. Shelby is present,” said Mr. Shelby. “I regret to say that the young woman, excited by overhearing, or having reported to her, something of this business, has taken her child in the night, and made                off.”“I did expect fair dealing in this matter, I confess,’ said Haley.“If any man calls my honor in question, I have but one answer for\n",
      "Black Sam, a negro, was asked to cotch Bill and Jerry by Mas’r Haley. “You teach your granny!” said Sam, with infinite contempt; “knowed it a progressivelyheap sight sooner than you did; this nigger an’t so green, now!’ “I’d a said that Missis would a scoured the varsal world after Lizy,” added Sam\n",
      "Sam Shelby was told to go with Mr. Haley to a vacant place at St. James’ or Washington. He rode with Bill and Jerry in a full canter, and adroitly threw himself off before they had any idea of stopping. He brought them up alongside of the                horse-post like a tornado. Haley’s horse, a skittish young                colt, winced and bounced, and pulled hard at his halter.\n",
      "Haley’s horse, which was a white one, and very fleet and spirited, appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto. The instant Haley touched the saddle, the mettlesome creature bounded from the earth with a sudden spring, that threw his master sprawling, some feet off. Sam, with frantic ejaculations, made a dive at the reins, but only succeeded in brushing the blazing palm-leaf afore-named into the horse’\n",
      "Haley and Sam were walking the horses to dinner, when they came across a horse reeking of sweat. The horse was cotched, and the two men went to wash him down. Sam, in a deprecating tone, said that he thought Haley was trying to kill them all. The two men laughed to their heart's content.\n",
      "in’? Didn’t I see what Missis wanted,                though she never let on? Dat ar’s bobservation, Andy. I ’spects it”s what you may call a faculty. Faculties is different in different people, but cultivation of ’em goes a great way.”\n",
      "Eliza's husband's suffering and dangers, and the danger of her child, all blended in her mind. She strained him to her bosom with aconvulsive grasp, as she went rapidly forward. The frosty ground creaked beneath her feet, and she trembled at the quaking leaf.\n",
      "Eliza's plan was to escape across the Ohio river. She was many miles past any neighborhood where she was personally known. As she was also so white as not to be known as of coloredlineage, and her child was white also, it was much easier for her to pass on unsuspected.\n",
      "Eliza, who had been walking all day to get to the ferry, was stopped by a woman. The woman asked Eliza if she had anybody sick. Eliza said she had a dangerous child, and that she was trying to take him to a man who would tote him over to supper. The man said he would try, if it was prudent.\n",
      "“Chil’en!” said a voice, that made them all start. It was Uncle Tom, who had come in, and stood listening to the conversation at the door. Aunt Chloe covered her face with her checked apron, and began to sob in good earnest. “Don’t tear der suckin’ baby right off his mother’s breast, and sell him,’ said Aunt Chloe, beginning to cry, “\n",
      "Tom Shelby was eight years old when ole Missis put you into my arms, and you wasn’t a year old. ‘Tom, that’s to be _your_ young Mas’r; take good care on him,’ says she. “And sure as I am a Christian woman,” said Mrs. Shelby, “you shall beredeemed as soon as I can any way bring together means.”\n",
      "Haley, notwithstanding that he was a very old bird, and naturally.inclined to be suspicious of chaff, was rather brought up by this view of the case. He asked Sam and Andy when they should come to it, and asked them to come to the other side of the estate when they were ready. He said he would take the straight road to the river, while Sam suggested a dirt road.\n",
      "Haley, accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies, thought that it lay in favor of the dirt road aforesaid. Andy wasn’t certain; he’d only “hearn tell” about that road, but never “been over it.” Eliza laid her child to sleep in the same place that the party had riding into the village. The road, in fact, was an old one, that had formerly been athorough\n",
      "Eliza caught her child, and caught a full glimpse of her just as she was disappearing down the bank. She leaped over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of ice beyond. It was a desperate leap—impossible to anything but madness and despair. She recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not farfrom her old home.\n",
      "“The gal’s got seven devils in her, I believe!” said Haley. “How like a wildcat she jumped!’ said Sam. � “Lord bless you, Mas’r, I couldn’t help it now,” says Sam, giving way to the long pent-up delight of his soul.\n",
      "Eliza made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk of dusk. A brawny, muscular man, full six feet in height, was standing by the bar. He was dressed in a coat of buffalo-skin, which gave him a shaggy and fierce appearance.\n",
      "Marks, Loker, and Haley sat down at a table in the parlor of Loker’s house. Marks began a pathetic recital of his peculiar troubles. Loker shut up his mouth, and listened to him with gruff and surly attention. Marks, who was anxiously and with much fidgeting compounding a tumbler of punch, gave the most earnest heed to the whole narrative.\n",
      "“Wal, jest so with me,” said Haley. “Last summer, down on Red River, I                got a gal traded off on me, with a likely lookin’ child enough, and his eyes looked as bright as yourn; but, come to look, I found him stone blind.” “Boh!’ said Tom Loker, “don’t I know with me too sick by this? I\n",
      "“I b’lieve in religion, and one of these days, when I’ve got matters tight and snug, I calculates to tend to my soul and them ar matters,” said Mr. Haley. “I can stand most any talk o’ yourn but your pious talk, that kills me right up.” “Come, come, gentlemen, I say; this isn’t business,’ said Marks. �\n",
      "“Ye see,” said Marks to Haley, stirring his punch as he did so, “we has justices convenient at all p’ints along shore, that does up any little jobs in our line quite reasonable.” “But, gentlemen, an’t I to come in for a share of the profits?’ said Haley. “An’n it enough we catch the boy for ye?” says Loker. �\n",
      "“I want, by a long jump,” said Tom. “Ye don’t think I                did business with you, down in Natchez, for nothing, Haley; I’ve                learned to hold an eel, when I catch him.” “Why, when you have a job in hand that may bring a clean profit of. about a thousand or sixteen hundred, why, Tom, you’re onreasonable\n",
      "“I heard the woman say there was one coming along this evening, and that a man was going to cross over in it. Neck or nothing, we must go with him,” said Tom. “Here’s her shawl she left on the bed in her hurry; she left her bonnet, too.” “Our dogs tore a feller half-to pieces, once, down in Mobile, ’fore we could get �\n",
      "“There’s an awful feeling of guilt about it, though,” said Mrs. Shelby. “Here, Andy, you nigger, be alive!” called Sam, under the verandah; “take these yer hosses to der barn; don’t ye hear Mas’r a callin’?”\n",
      "Sam Shelby told his story to his wife, Mrs. Shelby, of the incident with Lizy and Mas’r Haley. “God be praised, she isn’t dead!” she said; “but where is the poor child now?” “De Lord will pervide,” said Sam, rolling up his eyes piously, “as I’ve been a sayin’, dis yer ’\n",
      "Sam considered oratory as his                vocation, and never let slip an opportunity of magnifying his office. Between Sam and Aunt Chloe there had existed, from ancient times, a sort of chronic feud, or rather a decided coolness. Sam decided to be eminently conciliatory; for he well knew that although “Missis’ orders” would undoubtedly be followed to the letter, yet he should gain a considerable deal by enlisting the spirit also.\n",
      "“Niggers! all on yer,” said Sam, waving his palm-leaf with benignity. “What’s principles good for, if we isn’t persistent, I wanter know? Thar, Andy, you may have dat ar bone,—tan’n picked quite clean.”\n",
      "In which It Appears That a Senator Is But a Man and Not a Politician. The story of Senator Bird and his wife is told in an intimate setting. Mrs. Bird was a timid little woman, with mild blue eyes and a peach-blow-blow voice. Her husband and children were more entreaty and arousing by command or argument.\n",
      "“I’ll tell you what,” Master Bill used to say, “we boys never stoned another kitten!” “Obeying God never brings on public evils. I know it can’t. It’s alwayssafest, all round, to _do as He_ bids us”\n",
      "John Bird, a senator from New York, was called to his wife's house. His wife, a colored woman, was in a state of agony. She was bleeding from a cut on her foot. Her husband, a black man-of-all-work, was at her side. Mr. Bird tried to reason with his wife.\n",
      "“God bless you!” said the woman, covering her face and sobbing; while the little boy, seeing her crying, tried to get into her lap. “When she wakes up and feels a little rested, we will see,’ said Mrs. Bird, “We’ll see.”\n",
      "The woman looked up at Mrs. Bird, with a keen, scrutinizing glance, and it did not escape her that she was dressed in deep mourning. “Ma’am,” she said, suddenly, “have you ever lost a child?” “No, sir—no! my mistress was always good to me.”\n",
      "A woman tells her husband that her husband is threatening to sell her to another man. Her husband says she must get away from the house, this very night. The woman says she is going to Canada, which is not very far off. The husband says he will help her get there, but it will take some time.\n",
      "“Your heart is better than your head, in this case, John,” said the wife of a senator. “Could I ever have loved you, had I not known you better than you know yourself?” “I’m thinking I shall feel rather cheap there, after all that’s been said and done; but, hang it, I can’t help it!”\n",
      "Mary Bird, the wife of a U.S. senator, was visiting her daughter-in-law, Eliza, in Kentucky. Mrs. Bird was sleeping, but her husband woke her at the sound of the doorbell. She rushed to the door, where she was met by Eliza and her child. Eliza was distraught, and could not speak.\n",

He had fiery eyes, coal-black hair, a strong, fine Roman profile, and a rich brown complexion. I had blue eyes, golden hair, an outline, a Greek outline, and fair complexion. He was active and observing, I dreamy and dreamy. Truthful we both were; he from pride\n",

      "“There was a time in my life when I had plans and Hopes of doing something in this world, more than to float and drift,” said St. Clare. “I had vague, indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipator.” “Why didn’t you?” asked Miss Ophelia;—“you ought not to put your hand to the plough, and look back.�”\n",
      "Miss Ophelia and Marie were sitting at the table with their cousin. Marie said that there was a mustering among the masses, the world over, and there is a _dies iræ_ coming on, sooner or later. “I suppose you’ll think, cousin,” she said, “that we are all barbarians.” “But I don’t.think you are all Barbarians,’ said Miss Ophel\n",

      "Tom was writing a letter to his wife, Eva, and their children. He was in a great deal of trouble, for the forms of some of the letters he had forgotten entirely. He did not know exactly which to use. He asked St. Clare to accompany him to a loft over the stable, where he could write.\n",
      "“It’s very important he should write,” said Eva, “because his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa.” “I rather think, Tom, you’d better get me to write your letter for you. I’ll do it when I come home from my ride,’ said St. Clare.\n",
      "St. Clare brought along a little negro girl, about eight or nine years of age. She was dressed in a single filthy, ragged garment, made of bagging. She stood with her hands demurely folded before her. There was something odd and goblin-like about her appearance. St. Clare, like a mischievous fellow as he was, appeared to enjoy herastonishment.\n",
      "Miss Ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival. She was forced to do it herself, with some ungracious and reluctantassistance from Jane. When she saw the child on the back on the callers, she went through the disgusting details with heroic thoroughness.\n",

      "Miss Ophelia’s ideas of education, like all her other ideas, were very set and definite. They were of the kind that prevailed in New England acentury ago, and which are still preserved in some very retired andunsophisticated parts, where there are no railroads. As nearly as could nearly be expressed, they could be comprised in very few words: to teach them to mind when they were spoken to, to teach the catechism, sewing,\n",

Topsy confessed to the ribbon and gloves, with woful protestations of penitence. Eva came innocently into the room with the coral necklace.\n",
      "The Saxon and the Afric were representatives of the two extremes of society. The Saxon was born of ages of cultivation, education, physical and moral eminence; the Afric, born of oppression, submission, ignorance, toil and vice. When Miss Ophelia expatiated on Topsy’s naughty, wicked conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, “Poor Topsy, why need you steal?”\n",
      "“You have started a serious question,” said St. Clare, “I wish you’danswer it. What is to be done with a human being that can be governed only by the lash?” “Well, I can’t say I thank you for the experiment, as it appears to be a duty, I shall persevere and try, and do the best I can,’ said Miss Ophelia.\n",
      "Topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants. They soon found reason to alter their opinion. Whoever cast an indignity on Topsy was sure to meet with an accident shortly after. The times for revenge on Rosa and Jane, the two chamber maids, were always chosen.\n",
      "Topsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormities, considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing. St. Clare busied herself very earnestly on Sundays, teaching Topsy the catechism. Topsy had an uncommon verbal memory, and committed with a fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress.\n",
      "St. Clare took a wicked pleasure in Topsy's mistakes, calling her to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her to repeat the offending passages.

Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room, and running through the whole length of the house. He was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby was busy with some fine sewing; she seemed like one who had something on her mind. “Do you know,” she said, “that Chloe has\n",

The friendship between Tom and Eva had grown with the child’s growth.\n",
      "Little Eva saw a sea of glass, mingled with fire, on the shores of Lake Pontchartrain. She told her uncle, Tom, of the wondrous something yet to be revealed. Tom sang a hymn to her, and she said, “Uncle Tom, I’ve seen those spirits; and they sometimes come to me in my sleep’”\n",
      "“Uncle Tom,” said Eva, “I’m going there.” “Where, Miss Eva?” he asked. “To the spirits bright, Tom; I’'m going, before long_.”“Has there ever been a child like Eva? Yes, there have been; but their names are always on grave-stones, and their sweet smiles, their singular words and ways, are among the buried treasures\n",
      "The child’s whole heart and soul seemed absorbed in works of love and kindness. She still loved to play with Topsy, and the various coloredcoloredchildren. She would sit for half an hour at a time, laughing at the incomprehensible tricks of Topsy. But then a shadow would seem to pass across her face, her eyes grew misty, and her thoughts were afar.\n",

Tom feels it—Mammy does,—a great many of them do. I think it’s wrong.”\n",

      "Alfred and Augustine were playing backgammon on the verandah. Alfred said he found it difficult to train children under his system. He said he would send Henrique North for an education, where obedience is morefashionable. “Sons trained like your Henrique will be grand guardians of yourpowder-magazines,” said Augustine. ‘They that cannot govern themselves cannot govern others,’ said Alfred.\n",
      "“Good heavens! what perfectly dazzling beauty!” said Alfred. “I tell you, Auguste, won’t she make some hearts ache, one of these days?” “She will, too truly,—God knows I’m afraid so!’ said St. Clare, in a tone of sudden bitterness.\n",
      "Marie St. Clare had taken no notice of the child’s gradually decaying health and strength. She was completely absorbed in studying two or three new forms of disease to which she believed she herself was a victim. She always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one around her could be sick.\n",
      "Marie paraded her new misery as the reason and apology for all sorts of                inflictions on every one about her. Every word that was spoken by anybody, everything that was done or was not done everywhere, was only proof that she was surrounded by hard-hearted, insensible beings. Poor Eva heard some of these speeches; and nearly cried her little eyes out, in pity for hermamma.\n",

There are some things I ought to do; and you are unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject. But it must come off.\n",

      "St. Clare found a strange calm coming over him. It was not hope, but a calm resting in the present, which seemed so beautiful that he wished to think of no future. Tom, at last, would not sleep in his room, but lay all night in theouter verandah.\n",
      "Eva's father had been in, in the evening, and said that Eva appeared more like her former self than ever she had done since her sickness. Miss Ophelia, who had resolved to sit up all night with her little charge, had discerned what experienced nurses call “a change.”\n",

A glorious smile passed over her face, and she said, “O! love,—joy,—peace!” “Farewell, beloved child! the bright, eternal doors have closed,” said St. Clare. “We shall see thy sweet face no more.

      "St. Clare wanted to take Topsy Vermont to the free States. He asked Miss Ophelia to write him a deed of gift or legal paper. He was annoyed by her downrightness. She wrote off a deed, and he signed his name to it with a flourish. St. Clare then gave Topsy to Miss Vermont.\n",
      "St. Clare heard Tom whispering to himself in his Bible. St. Clare asked Tom to read to him, and read a passage from it.

It was an order, written in Marie's delicate Italian hand, to give the bearer fifteen lashes.\n",

Tom was a long time in accomplishing the application of cold water to his wounds.\n",
      "“I’ve been on this place five years, body and soul, under this man’s foot; and I hate him as I do the devil! Here you are, on a lone                plantation, ten miles from any other, in the swamps; not a white person here, who could testify, if you were burned alive, or scalded, or cut into inch-pieces, set up for the dogs to tear, or hung up and\n",

      "“You see me now,” she said, speaking to Tom very rapidly; “see what I                am! Well, I was brought up in luxury; the first I remember is, playing about, when I was a child, in splendid parlors.” She went to a convent, and there she learned music, French and embroidery, and what not; and when she was 14, she came out to her father’s funeral.\n",
      "“I thought I was as happy as any one could be; but then there came evil times. He had a cousin come to New Orleans, who was his particular friend. I felt sure he was going to bring misery on us. He got Henry to going out with him, and often he would not come home nights until two or three o’clock. I did not dare say a word; for Henry was so high spirited, I was afraid to.” �\n",
      "“I was so gloomy and silent, that none of them wanted me. They threatened to whip me, if I wasn't gayer, and didn’t take some pains to make myself agreeable. At length, one day, came a gentleman named. purposefullyStuart. He seemed to have some feeling for me; he saw that something.dreadful was on my heart, and he came to me alone, and finally persuaded me to tell him. He bought me\n",
      "“I would never again let a child live to grow up! I took the little fellow in my arms when he was two weeks old, and kissed him, and cried over him; and then I gave him laudanum, and held him close to my bosom, while heslept to death. What better than death could I give him, poor child! After a while, the cholera came, and Captain Stuart died; everybody died that wanted to live;\n",
      "Tom looked as if he would speak again; but she cut him short, with a decidedlydecided gesture. She laid her hand on her breast and decidedlydrew in her breath, as if to lift a heavy weight. “Don’t talk, my poor fellow. Try to sleep, if you can.”\n",

      "When Legree brought Emmeline to the house, all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up in the worn heart of Cassy. Legree, in a fury, swore that she should be put to field service, if she would not be peaceable. Cassy, with proud scorn, declared she would go to the field. And she worked there one day, as we have described, to show how perfectly she purposefullyscorned the threat.\n",
      "Legree was born of a hard-tempered sire, on whom that                gentle woman had wasted a world of unvalued love. Boisterous, unruly, and tyrannical, he broke from her, to seek his fortunes at sea. He never came home but once, after; and then, his mother, with the yearning of aHeart that must love something, and has nothing else to love, clung to him.\n",
      "Legree was often wont, when in a gracious humor, to get his two sable drivers into his sitting-room, and, after warming them up with whiskey, amuse himself by setting them to singing, dancing or fighting. Cassy was returning from her ministrations to poor Tom, that she heard the sound of wild, pathetic singing, whooping, halloing, and singing.\n",
      "Cassy entered the room and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear, in the furthest corner of it. “O Cassy, is it you? I’m so glad you’ve come! I was afraid it was—. O, you don’t know what a horrid noise there has been, down                stairs, all this evening!” “I ought to know,” said Cassy. ‘I�\n",
      "“I wish I’d never been born!” said Emmeline, wringing her hands. “That’s an old wish with me,’ said Cassy, “I’ve got used to wishing that.” “The sisters told me things, when I was in the convent, thatmake me afraid to die. If it would only be the end of us, why, then—”\n",
      "“I’ll let him off at what he’s got,” said Legree; “but he shall promise better fashions.” “That he won’t do,’ said Cassy. “No, he won't,“ said Cassie. Legree, though he talked so stoutly to Cassy, still sallied forth from the house with a degree of misgiving which was not\n",

      "George and Eliza Harris, with their child, were driven privately into Sandusky. They were preparatory to taking their last passage on the lake. Jim, with his old mother, was forwarded separately; and a night or two after, George andEliza were driven to Sandusky, and put in a hospital.\n",
      "Eliza Smyth and her husband, George, were fleeing with their young son, Harry. Mrs. Smyth, a respectable woman from the settlement in Canada, had consented to appear as the aunt of little Harry. George had been allowed to remain, the two last days, under her sole charge; and an extra amount of petting, jointed to an indefinite amount of seed-cakes and candy.\n",
      "George and his wife stood arm in arm as the boat neared the small town of Amherstberg, in Canada. They stood still till the boat had cleared; and then, with tears and embracings, the husband and wife, with their wondering child in their arms, knelt down and lifted their hearts to God!\n",
      "The martyr, when faced even by a death of bodily anguish and horror, finds in the very terror of his doom a strong stimulant and tonic. Tom thought he could bear torture and fire, with the vision of Jesus and heaven but just a step beyond; but when he was gone, the pain of his bruised and weary limbs came back. The gloomiest problem of this mysterious life was constantly before Tom's eyes.\n",
      "“You were a fool,” said Legree, “for I meant to do well by you, when I bought you. You might have been better off than Sambo, or Quimbo either, and had easy times.” “You see the Lord an’t going to help you; if he had been, he wouldn’ve let _me_ get you!

How I hate these cursed Methodist hymns! Here, you nigger,’ said he, coming out upon Tom, and raising his riding-whip.\n",
      "Of all races of the earth, none have received the Gospel with such eager docility as the African. The African's reliance and unquestioning faith, which is its foundation, is more a native element in this race than any other. A stray seed of truth, borne on some breeze into hearts the most ignorant, has sprung up into fruit.\n",
      "“Misse Cassy,” said Tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her in silence, “if ye only could get away from here, I’d ’vise ye and Emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go without blood-guiltiness.” Cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast eyes. “When we can love and pray over all,\n",
      "Cassy had often revolved, for hours, all possible or probable schemes of escape, and dismissed them all, as hopeless and impracticable. But at this moment there flashed through her mind a plan, so simple and Feasible in all its details, as to awaken an instant hope.\n",

I’d like to have you tell me,’ said Simon, “With an oath, I suppose,\n",
      "The influence of Cassy over Legree was of a strange and singular kind. Legree had had the slumbering moral elements in him roused by his encounters with Tom. But still there was a thrill and commotion of the dark,inner world, produced by every word.\n",
      "“You don’t believe in ghosts, do you, Cass?” said he, taking the tongs and settling the fire. “I thought you’d more sense than to let noises purposefullyscare _you_.” “No matter what I believe,” says Cassy, sullenly. ‘Fellows used to try to frighten me with their yarns at sea,’ said Legree. �\n",
      "Cassy and Emeline had been on the best of terms with Legree. Cassy had cajoled him to take her with him to a neighboring town. She had accumulated a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time. She then transferred article by article, a greater part of her and Emmmeline’s wardrobe.\n",
      "Cassy and Emmeline escaped from the plantation. They were pursued by Legree, the overseer of the plantation, who pursued them through the swamps. Cassy planned a diversion to avoid the pursuers. She and EmMeline waded into a deep creek to hide from Legree. Legree followed them, but Cassy led the way.\n",
      "Cassy and Emmeline went down to the swamp, followed by every servant in the house. The whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air. Cassy took a key from the pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his hurry. She unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted rapidly.\n",
      "Legree, cursing his ill luck, and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow, went to bed. Emmeline fell into a doze, and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses’ feet, and the baying of dogs.\n",
      "This poem does not appear in the collected works of William Cullen-Bryant. It was probably copied from a newspaper or magazine. An eternal, inexorable lapse of moments is ever hurrying the day of the evil to an eternal night. “Deem not the just by Heaven forgot! Though life its common gifts deny”\n",
      "Cassy placed her ear at the knot-hole; and, as the morning air blew directly towards the house, she could overhear a good deal of the conversation. The men are, two of them, overseers of plantations in the vicinity; and others were some of Legree’s associates at the tavern-bar of a neighboring city, who had come for the interest of the sport. A grave sneer overcast the dark, severe gravity of her face,\n",
      "Tom heard the message with a forewarning heart. He knew the deadly character of the man he had to deal with, and his despotic power. But he felt strong in God to meet death, rather than betray the helpless. He sat his basket down by the row, and, looking up, said, “Into thyhands I commend my spirit! Thou hast redeemed me’\n",

      "Two men stole up to the house, and asked for a drink of brandy of Legree. One of them brought it back, and poured it down Tom's throat. “O, Tom!” said Quimbo, “we’s been awful wicked to ye.” “I forgive ye, with all my heart!’ said Tom, faintly.\n",
      "George Shelby, a young man, bought a young boy, named Tom, in New Orleans. The boy was lost among the swamps of the Red River. George Shelby sent a letter of inquiry to a lawyer who did business for the St. Clares. The lawyer said he knew nothing of the matter, and sold the boy at a public auction. George went to New Orleans to find out where Tom was, and to buy him back.\n",
      "Tom had been lying two days since the fatal night, not suffering, for every nerve of suffering was blunted and destroyed. He lay, for the most part, in a quiet stupor; for the laws of a powerful and well-knit frame would not at once release the imprisoned spirit. By stealth, there had been there, in the darkness of the night, poor desolated creatures, who stole from their scanty hours’ rest, to give him some of\n",
      "“The old Satan!” said George, in his indignation. “It’s a comfort tothink the devil will pay _him_ for this, some of these days!’“O, don’t!—oh, ye mustn’T!“ said Tom, grasping his hand; “he’'s a poorMis’able critter! it’�s awful to think on ’t\n",
      "George turned, and, with one hugelyindignant blow, knocked Legree flat upon his face. He stood with wrath and defiance, blazing with wrath. The negroes looked dejected, and walked off in silence.“Witness, eternal God!” said George, kneeling on the grave of his poor friend. “oh, witness, that, from this hour, I will do what one man can_ to drive out this curse of slavery from my land!�\n",
      "Ghostly legends were uncommonly rife, about                this time, among the servants on Legree’s place. It was whisperingly asserted that footsteps, in the dead of night, had been heard descending the garret stairs, and patrolling the house. Legree could not help overhearing this whispering; and it was all the more exciting to him, from the pains that were taken to conceal it from him.\n",
      "Cassy was dressed after the manner of the Creole Spanish ladies. A small black bonnet on her head, covered by a veil thick with embroidery, concealed her face. She was to personate the character of a Creole lady, and Emmeline that of her servant. Cassy kept her room and bed on pretext of illness, during her illness.\n",
      "George Harris met a French lady named Cassy on a trip on a steamboat with his brother. Cassy’s chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation. She began to think that he suspected something; finally resolved to throw herself entirely on his generosity, and trusted him with her whole history.\n",
      "“A treasure,” said George; “a beautiful, intelligent, amiable girl. Very pious. My mother had brought her up, and trained her as carefully, almost, as a daughter. She could read and write, embroider and sew,                beautifully; and was a beautiful singer.” “Do you know the names of the people he bought her of?” she asked. “A man of the name of Simmons, I\n",

      "The note-book of a missionary, among the Canadian fugitives, contains truth stranger than fiction. The bond between mother and daughter grew up through the constant reading and affection. Cassy, who keeps little Eliza on her lap, squeezes the little thing in a manner that rather.astonishes her, and obstinately refuses to have her mouth stuffed with cake.\n",
      "Cassy de Thoux was the daughter of an African-American woman. Her brother, George, was born into slavery. George was educated in France. He wrote to a friend about his plans for the future. He said he had no desire to mingle with the whites in the U.S.\n",

This is what I go for; and in this I am quite sure I shall not be disappointed.” George Shelby.\n",
      "George Shelby had written to his mother merely a line, stating the day                that she might expect him home. Of the death scene of his old friend he had not the heart to write. He had tried several times, and only succeeded in half choking himself. Mrs. Shelby had consented to Polly's request that the bills in which her husband had been paid should be preserved to show her husband's memory.\n",
      "George Shelby, the partriarchal negro, who had grown gray and blind on the estate, rose, lifting his trembling hand, and said, “Let the Lord give us unto the Lord’s blessing, and thank us for the blessing of freedom” A month after this, all the servants of the Shelby estate were convened together in the great hall that ran through the house, to hear a few words from their young master.

      "The writer has often been inquired of, by correspondents from different parts of the country, whether this narrative is a true one. Many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself, or reported to her by her personal friends. Some of the most deeply tragic and romantic incidents, have also their parallels in reality.\n",
      "The histories of Emmeline and Cassy may have many counterparts. The fairness of mind and generosity attributed to St. Clare are not without a parallel. The author hopes she has done justice to that nobility, generosity, and humanity, which in many cases characterize individuals at the South. She has endeavored to show the system fairly, in its best and worst phases.\n",
      "The writer has given only a faint shadow, a dim picture, of the anguish and despair that are, at this very moment, riving thousands of hearts, and driving a helpless and sensitive race to frenzy and despair. The people of the free states have defended and encouraged, and are more guilty for it, before God, than the South, because they have not the apology of education or custom.\n",
      "The writer asks: Do you believe in prayer? Do you pray for the heathen abroad? And pray for those distressed Christians whose whole chance of religious improvement is an accident of trade and sale. The writer has lived, for many years, on the frontier-line of slave-states, and has had great observation among those who were formerly slaves.\n",
      "The author gives the following statement of facts, on the authority ofProfessor C. E. Stowe, then of Lane Seminary, Ohio, with regard to slaves, now resident in Cincinnati. This is given to show thecapability of the race, even without any very particular assistance orencouragement.\n",
      "“Both North and South have been guilty before God; and the Christian church has a heavy account to answer. Not by combining together, to protect injustice and cruelty, to make a common capital of sin, is this Union to be saved” “Not surer is the eternal law by which the millstone sinks in the ocean, than that stronger law, by which injustice and Cruelty shall bring on nations the wrath of Almighty God!”\n"
